把生活想象成一个在空中抛接五只球的游戏。
Imagine life as a game in which you are juggling some five balls in the air.
这五只球被你分别称为：工作、家庭、健康、友谊和精神。你努力不让它们从空中掉下来。
You name them: Work, Family, Health, Friends, Spirit. And you re keeping all of these in the air.
你马上就发现惟有工作是一个橡皮球。
You will soon understand that work is a rubber ball.
如果你将它掉到地上，它还会弹回来。但其它四只球――家庭、健康、朋友和精神都是玻璃的。
If you drop it, it will bounce back. But the other four balls-family, health, friends and spirit are made of glass.
如果你把任何一个掉到地上，便会不可挽回地留下疤痕、裂缝、受损甚至摔得粉碎。
If you drop one of these, they will be irrevocably scuffed , marked, nicked , damaged or even shattered .
它们永远也无法恢复原样。你必须懂得这一点并在生活中努力保持平衡。
They will never be the same. You must understand that and strive for balance in your life.
怎样做到这一点呢？
How?
不要总拿自己与别人比从而贬低自身的价值。正因为我们彼此的差异不同，我们才会各有千秋。
Don't undermine your worth by comparing yourself with others. It is because we are different that each of us is special. 
别人认为重要，并不能作为你确定目标的根据。只有你自己知道，什么东西对你最好。
Don't set your goals by what other people deem important. Only you know what is best for you. 
与你内心最贴近的东西，切莫等闲视之。要像坚守生命一样坚守住它们，因为失去它们，生活就会毫无意义。
Don t take for granted the things closest to your heart. Cling to them as you would cling to your life, for without them, life is meaningless.
不要耽于过去或未来，而让生命从指间悄悄溜走。一次只活一天，活在今日，你就充实地活过生命中的每一天。
Don t let your life slip through your fingers by living in the past or for the future.By living your life one day at a time, you live all the days of your life. 
如果你还可以付出，就不要轻言放弃。在你停止努力那一刻之前，什么都没有真正结束。
Don't give up when you still have something to give. Nothing is really over until the moment you stop trying. 
正因为我们都不完美，我们才会彼此需要。
Don't be afraid to admit that you are less than perfect. It is this fragile thread that binds us each together. 
不要害怕遭遇风险。只有通过冒险，我们才能学会如何变得勇敢。
Don't be afraid to encounter risks. It is by taking chances that we learn how to be brave.
别说真爱难求，而将爱拒之门于生活之外。获得爱的捷径是给予爱，失去爱的捷径是扼住爱，而守住爱的捷径是给爱插上翅膀。
Don't shut love out of your life by saying it s impossible to find. The quickest way to receive love is to give; the fastest way to lose love is to hold it too tightly; and the best way to keep love is to give it wings.
不要一生奔忙，匆匆而过，以至于忘了自己从何而来，往何而去。
Don't run through life so fast that you forget not only where you ve been, but also where you are going.
不要忘记一个人最大的感情需要是得到别人的理解。
Don't forget, a person's greatest emotional need is to feel appreciated.
不要害怕学习。知识没有重量：它是你随时可以轻松携带的宝藏。
Don't be afraid to learn. Knowledge is weightless, a treasure you can always carry easily.
不要漫不经心地打发时间或口无遮拦地说话，失去的时间和说出去的话都无法挽回。
Don't use time or words carelessly. Neither can be retrieved.
生活不是一场赛跑，而是每一步都宜细细品尝的人生旅程。
Life is not a race, but a journey to be savored each step of the way.
昨天属于历史。明天是未知的谜。而今天是赐予我们的礼物：所以我们把“今天”称之为"礼物"。
Yesterday is history, Tomorrow is a mystery and Today is a gift: that's why we call it "The Present"
